# timemit - Why another stopwatch?

I **love** using stopwatches – especially over prolonged time intervals. However, there is one extremely infuriating property of the stock stopwatch app: A single, perhaps accidental, touch of the dreaded «Reset» circle annihilates everything. Permanently.

So what does _timemit_ do differently? First and foremost, rather than expunging all your precious records instantaneously, pressing «Reset» will ask for your confirmation. Furthermore, you can modify, delete and rename the splits. Seriously, why are the splits called laps? I for one have never used an iPhone to track my running.

## But really, why?

Having used [Ionic in combination with Angular](https://city-ol.ch/) for cross-platform app development for close to 6 years, I finally wanted to overcome my fear of React and this project seemed destined for such a learning-by-doing experiment.
